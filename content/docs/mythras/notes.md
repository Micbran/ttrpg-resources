## Rules Modifications
### Experience
- Want there to be some sort of +1 ASI sort of deal.

### Modifications to Skills
- Subskills: Boosting a skill that has a subskill allows you to increase the subskill by 1/2 the amount, as long as it remains lower than the skill you boosted.
  - Example: Healing (P) has First Aid (S) as a subskill, if you have 30% Healing and 20% First Aid, and boost Healing by 4%, First Aid increases by 2% as well.
  - The increase rounds up, and has a min of 1.
  - If there are multiple subskills, you only pick ONE to get the increase. You can use a subskill increase to purchase a new specialty, but it has to make sense.
  - Reminder that they do not always go both ways. 
  - Professional -> Standard pairings:
    - Healing: First Aid
    - Seamanship: Boating
    - Sleight: Conceal
    - Oratory, Commerce: Influence
  - Professional -> Professional parings:
    - Lockpicking: Mechanisms, and vice versa.
  - Standard -> Standard pairings:
    - Athletics: Swim, and vice versa.
  - Skills with large number of specializations pairings:
    - Performance: All specializations
    - Art: All specializations
    - Lore: All specializations, Engineering, Streetwise, Bureaucracy and vice versa. 
      - With the additional caveat that any subskill increase derived from increasing these skills has to make sense.
        - i.e. increasing Bureaucracy as a consequence of working in the government of a nation called Xanthos would allow you to increase Lore (Xanthos History) or Lore (Xanthos) or Lore (Xanthos Nobility) so on, so forth, or if the nation was known for being a magocracy with a focus on rituals, then Lore (Rituals) might even be appropriate. You get the point.
- Performance (S) (Cha + *)
  - Acting (Cha)
  - Dance (Dex)
  - Musicianship (Dex) (and all of the Musicianship specialties)
  - Sing (Pow)
  - Required choice of specialization, all are subskills to each other.
- Language (P) gives you a number of specializations equal to Language / 20% (rounded up) all based on the same Language skill. You can still take multiple specialties, which gives you multiple 'groupings' of languages at the same mastery (%). In essence, they're subskills but they get the full value, and you get more of them. 
- Seduction is removed. Both because it's awkward and I don't think it really adds anything.
- Literacy is removed because I don't feel like dealing with it.
- Courtesy is removed.
- Gambling is removed because I did not write it down on my first pass, realized it was a skill and went "yeah, I didn't miss much."

## Other Things
### Magic Summary
- What magical disciplines are available?
- What magical traditions control magic?
- How many magical abilities do traditions provide?
- How long does magic take to cast?
- How is magical energy generated and recovered?
  - What happens when you run out?
- Can characters start with magic?

- Some notes
  - You can combine traditions or snipe from other lists
  - Different forms of magic can work differently, casting times and the like.
  - The access to spells / abilities is the main limiter.

- Most magic traditions will be some sorcery access with some Theism spells access
- Invocation will be Int + Cha instead of Int x 2, Shaping will still be in effect, not sure if the Theistic spells will be under a different tradition or not.

## What would I need to run a game?
- Revised cultures (one for each empire + Nomadic)
- Revised communities
- Revised careers (changing skills around, maybe adding culture-specific ones, changing / removing magic ones)
- Combat Styles
- A solid understanding of the rules (lol!)
- A few basic magic tradition ideas. Or at least enough to run with them. I think I can actually put this off until players want to interact with them.
- A oneshot / twoshot to see if we even want to play, so that probably takes precedent. Except I'm dumb as hell, and will gladly do all this legwork.
