- They have a whole lot of free time from never having to do basic, hard work tasks.
- Also the horn provides way more than natural resources, it kinda freely interprets things from the
collective consciousness taken specifically from a certain group of people (yeah, like insanely racist shit, like pure race shit), that then, the rest of them (basically those born near the horn) participate in society have a chance to simply get a few things they want, from the horn. deliveries are done through nature, these people cultivate a lot of nature. they also really hate each other. if anyone could get along in the society it would be so over.
- To expand on this, there's basically these ultra-privleiged billionaire-esque "we're the only people that matter" kind of people that just have huge-ass families, and divide kids into groups to get them to 'will' certain things into existence, etc. They're also like super nationalist, and racist, especially against outsiders.
