## New Skill Rules
### Subskills
**Subskills**: Boosting a skill that has a **subskill** allows you to increase the **subskill** by 1/2 the amount you boosted it by, as long as the **subskill** is lower than the skill you boosted. This is meant to represent skills that have common avenues / intersections. 
- Example: Healing (P) has First Aid (S) as a subskill, if you have 30% Healing and 20% First Aid, and boost Healing by 4%, First Aid increases by 2% as well.
  - The increase rounds up, and has a min of 1.
  - If there are multiple subskills, you only pick **one** to get the increase. You can use a subskill increase to purchase a new specialty, but it has to make sense.
  - Reminder that skill-subskill pairings do not always go both ways. `->` denotes one way, `<->` denotes both ways.

#### Professional -> Standard pairings
- Healing (P) -> First Aid (S)
- Seamanship (P) -> Boating (S)
- Sleight (P) -> Conceal (S)
- Oratory (P), Commerce (P) -> Influence (S)

#### Professional -> Professional parings
- Lockpicking (P) <-> Mechanisms (P)

#### Standard -> Standard pairings
- Athletics (S) <-> Swim (S)

#### Skills with large number of specializations pairings
- **Performance (S)**: All specializations
- **Art (P)**: All specializations
- **Lore (P)**: All specializations, **Engineering (P)**, **Streetwise (P)**, **Bureaucracy (P)** and vice versa. 
    - With the additional caveat that any subskill increase derived from increasing these skills has to make sense.
    - e.g. increasing Bureaucracy as a consequence of working in the government of a nation called Xanthos would allow you to increase Lore (Xanthos History) or Lore (Xanthos) or Lore (Xanthos Nobility) so on, so forth, or if the nation was known for being a magocracy with a focus on rituals, then Lore (Rituals) might even be appropriate. You get the point.

### Language
Language (P) gives you a number of specializations equal to your Language / 20% (rounded up) all based on the same Language skill. You can still take multiple specialties, which gives you multiple 'groupings' of languages at the same mastery (%). In essence, they're subskills but they get the full value, and you get more of them.

### Removals
- Seduction is removed. Both because it's awkward and I don't think it really adds anything.
- Literacy is removed because I don't feel like dealing with it.
- Courtesy is removed.
- Gambling is removed because I did not write it down on my first pass, realized it was a skill and went "yeah, I didn't miss much."
