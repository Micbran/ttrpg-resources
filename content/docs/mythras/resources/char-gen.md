# Char Gen
- Base stat stuff, broken down into Characteristics (ability scores), Attributes (derived stats) and Standard Skills (skills everyone has)
- A lot of the values you're going to input (especially skills) are going to change a little. Beware!

## Steps

#### Character Concept (pg. 6)
- It's helpful to go in with a vague idea. Or just refresh yourself on what you _could_ be.
- To help you out, this one shot is set in a pretty generic low-ish fantasy setting, where magic is rare and 'spooky.'
- Some skill notes:
  - The 'travel' skills aren't likely to come up (Drive, Swim, Boating, ...), shocker!
  - Wilderness survival / knowledge stuff likely won't be used, you could _maybe_ angle Tracking.
  - Combat skills will _probably_ come up, since you're acting in a town guard sort of position.


#### Characteristics (pg. 7-8)
- Strength (Str)
- Constitution (Con)
- Size (Siz)
- Dexterity (Dex)
- Intelligence (Int)
- Power (Pow)
- Charisma (Cha)

1. Roll 4d6d1 (four dee six drop lowest one) 5 times (for Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Power and Charisma), and 2d6+7 2 times (for Size and Intelligence).
2. Write those numbers down! This is not in order / down the line.
3. Repeat this to get a second array.
4. Pick the one you like more.
5. Assign your characteristic scores. The 4d6d1 rolls can go into Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Power or Charisma. The 2d6+7 rolls can go into Size or Intelligence.

#### Attributes (pg. 8-10)
There's a couple of 'em. They're mostly derived from your Characteristics. Refer to the various charts.
- Action Points (Int + Dex)
- Damage Modifier (Str + Siz)
- Experience Modifier (Cha)
- Healing Rate (Con)
- Height and Weight (Siz)
- Hit Points per Hit Location (Con + Siz)
- Initiative Bonus ((Dex + Int) / 2)
- Luck Points (Pow)
- Magic Points (Pow)
- Movement Rate 6

So go figure all those out. Maybe change around a few attributes if you want to hit a breakpoint. You know the vibe. The Int + Dex AP one (25+) is pretty nice for combat stuff and isn't too hard to hit (you can generally hit it on average, if you're willing to put decent values on Int + Dex).

#### Standard Skills (pg. 11)
This is where the book tells you do find all your standard skill starting values. You can do this if you want, but we're going to be adding to them in a bit, so it depends on how you want to keep track of things. 

#### Culture (pg. 13-17)
Next, you pick your culture, getting you skills. When you pick a culture:
- Apply a +40% to the Customs and Native Tongue Standard Skills
- Select 3 Professional Skills from the options offered
- _If_ desired, select a single Combat Style, these are always Standard Skills. 
- Distribute 100 points amongst the listed Standard Skills, the chosen Professional Skills and the optional Combat Style, increasing the skill by 1% for every 1 point you spend.
- Two things here:
  - You must improve every skill.
  - Every skill must get at least a 5% increase, and a maximum of a 15% increase.

#### Background Events (pg. 17-20)
There's a background events chart. I'm not a huge fan of it. If we want to have something cool for a backstory, I'd rather the player just come up with it themselves. But, you're free to look at this if you want ideas or something. I'm not gonna stop you. Fuck it, roll on it. Realize your parents died when you were six or something. Go for it.

#### Community (pg. 21-25)
That's right, we're going to roll for social class. If you want to _choose_ a lower social class than what you roll, be my guest.

- Roll 4d6 x some value based on your culture for "base" starting money. -> pg. 21 
- Roll your first d100. This is your 'Social Class' roll. Figure out what social class you belong to based off of a chart. -> pg. 24
- Everything for the rest of Community is optional. It's just for fun. Why? Because it won't come up in the oneshot. Sorry. Well, I could make it so it does. But I probably won't.
- Roll another d100. This is your 'Connections' roll. Refer to the connections table. -> pg. 25
- Roll another d100. This is your 'Reputation' roll. Refer to the reputation table. -> pg. 25
  - For the 'Parents Table' and the 'Siblings Table' and the 'Extended Family Table', you can roll, or just pick, or just ignore them. -> pg. 25

#### Careers (pg. 28-33)
These work a lot like backgrounds, with some differences. Basically:
- Pick a career.
- Pick three Professional Skills from said career.
- Distribute 100 points across the Standard Skills and the three chosen Professional Skills.
- You _do not_ need to improve every skill, there is no minimum amount you need to improve them by, and the max is 15%. 

#### Bonus Skills (pg. 34)
- Distribute 150 points, no more than 15% in a single skill, across your stuff however you'd like.
  - Remember, you cannot invest in Professional Skills unless you got access to them previously. 
- You get one bonus Professional Skill, to represent a hobby. Or you can pick a Combat Style. But not both!

#### Starting Equipment (pg. 34-35)
- Refer to your Social Class, and the table. -> pg. 35 
- Spend your money. The hardest part.
  - Armor -> pg. 58
  - Random Shit -> pg. 60-61
  - Things that kill people -> pg. 63-65
