## Mythras Oneshot Idea
- Starts a little bit like Rise of the Runelords, players are in a decently-sized town for a once a decade festival.
  - So plenty of little festival games, food, drink and other fun stuff to deal with.
- Then, at some point during a pivotal point during the festival, an outcast sorcerer attacks with a band of bandits who have infiltrated the town and set up sabotages
  - You know, all things the players could pick up on before the whole thing. Or get a bad idea, and kick this whole thing off early.
  - Or make themselves enough of a problem for the bandits / sorcerer to confront them more directly / indirectly. 
- And from there, we go to combat, though I want to make it fairly dynamic, so there's some thinking there.

In short:
- Festival games, and roaming
- Hints of weird things, or suspicious people
- Grand speech -> culminates in an attack
  - Probably by starting a fire, and then apprehending people as they split up. Meanwhile, the other group dives for the church.

Things we need:
- Background
- List of festival games
- List of sabotages
- A real plot reason for the sorcerer doing this, and the bandits for helping
- The actual content of the oneshot, and all that shit. 

### Plot Stuff
- The sorcerer wants a specific relic that the town is responsible for guarding. They plan to steal it under the guise of a raid, so it looks less overt. If the raid goes well, fine, but if not, they still get the relic. To that end, the bandits are in two teams, one of them is the main raid group, the other are extracting the relic with the sorcerer.
  - Clue: Looking for a relic: People asking weird questions about the relic, people canvassing the town's church, someone REALLY asking for a tour of the church
  - Clue: Two groups: A tattoo or branding that ties the two groups together, they wear similar clothing / equipment, they can be seen talking to each other
  - Clue: A raid is imminent: Signs of sabotage, a stashed stockpile of weapons, 'preparations' for escape
  - Clue: Organizer is a sorcerer: The relic is said to secrete a single magical tear of joy once a decade (magical importance), strange things happening in and around the festival, charmed mayor, the firebombs, the strange power of the brand on the lieutenant
  - Clue: The sorcerer has deceived the bandits: The bandits believe there's something valuable monetary-wise in the cathedral, they think that he's just talented wordsmith and scholar, their tattoo is an unholy symbol but they believe it to be a symbol of fortune 

- General stuff:
  - 8 "main" bandits, one of them is a lieutenant sorta guy, one of them is the sorcerer them self.
  - They're gonna form two squads, 1 squad of 4, with the lieutenant, and another squad of 'disguised' bandits, with the sorcerer.
    - The first squad is going to pretend to be guards as well, working in squads of 2 and accomplishing various sabotage around town.
    - The second squad is going to spread out and 'case the joint' so to speak.
  - Maybe the Sorcerer tries to impersonate the mayor via magic? Noticeable by how he's acting different.
  
### Timeline
- Commencement speech in the square near the cathedral
- Released for fun and games
  - Need to identify several points of interest
- From there, players are open to discover several preliminary clues
- As time wears on, more and more 'sabotage' is accomplished

#### Characters
I used the various Celtic name generators and changed them up a bunch.
- The Sorcerer: 
  - Cellach Se (M)
- The Lieutenant: 
  - Caricx (M)
- The Bandits:
  - Carius (M)
  - Solovic (M)
  - Annaleise (F)
  - Martyn (M)
  - Morwyn (F)
  - Efa (M)

- Tattoo looks like a skull surrounded by green flames. Like one of those shitty edgy ones.
- 'Infiltration' Group
  - Callach Se, Annaleise, Efa, Carius
  - Hide their tattoo, Callach Se doesn't have one. 
- 'Raid' Group
  - Caricx, Solovic, Martyn, Morwyn
  - Openly display their tattoo, claiming they're part of a mercenary group, the Scorching Flames.

#### Circumstances
- The 'Raid' group, is officially part of the guard, making up about a third of the hired guard, they plan on scaring off another third
  - Caricx has been granted some minor infernal cantrip, that allows him to appear scarier. He uses this to cow others. His tattoo twists and morphs to make him scarier.
- The Raid group is carrying all sorts of weird things, but is also fine with improvising, honestly, they just appear as weirdly, overly ready mercenaries.

#### Sabotages
Ideally, make these some sort of roll table, but that's kind of awkward, since it's more suited to being a deck of cards. In total, they have 5 felflame devices. It could just be easier to pick out a few. 

- Beating / scaring off other hired guards (four in total)
- Planting firebombs in places where a fire would be bad. They usually try to make this worse, by putting dry material, or 'fuse' to other palaces (usually just rope), since hiding the bomb is more important than it being bad.
- Stockpiles of weapons placed in hidden places, smaller weapons near the outskirts, light armor scattered wherever, larger weapons near the church
- Traps near escape routes - Crates / barrels and whatnot stacked up in precarious positions, rope formed into a snare or tripwire
- Poisoned food / drink
- If they catch onto the players, they might start shadowing them, or using a member as bait, depending on what they feel. 
  - If they're shadowing them, they generally learn their capabilities, and attempt to ambush them when they split up / stumble upon some form of sabotage.
  - If they're using a member as bait, they try to lead them somewhere secluded / to a trap, and try to deal with them there. They might pull in extra help.

#### Investigative Infiltration Actions
Kinda the same deal as Sabotages, these are functionally random. 

- Pestering people about the church and asking weird questions
- Casing the joint
- Charming the mayor to make it easier to move about, and taking his key to the church.
- Clandestine discussions and meetings, sometimes with the other group (usually via a single liaison from each)
- Retrieving weapons / armor
- The sorcerer retreating before the raid to prepare different spells, enacting a dark ritual to prepare.
  - The ritual is a burnt offering of valuables and an eyeball, in this case, various bits of gems and gold. They are reduced to naught but ashes by the end of the ritual.

#### The Raid
1. The firebombs go off in the middle of the speech, smoke and flame begin rising in various parts throughout the town. Most people scramble to start a fire bucket brigade, other people just like incredibly worried, and look to start high-tailing it out of here. 
2. As people scatter, the Infiltration group goes to retrieve some larger pieces of gear, like swords. 
3. The Raid group makes themselves known, and attempts to draw people away from the church. 
4. The Infiltration enters the church once they feel the coast is clear, or if the coast isn't clear, just make a mad dash.
5. The Raid group mostly just tries to stop the townsfolk from putting the fire out, but also somewhat push towards the church.
6. The Infiltration group snatches the tear (and maybe a few other goodies) and begins to hightail it out of there, the Raid group not far behind.
7. Both groups push towards a common edge of town, utilizing the prepared traps to make their exit easier, when possible. The sorcerer only casts magic if he believes he needs to, but once he does, he does not stop casting till exhausted.

#### How This Works
Remember the social rules from War for the Crown? Yeah, maybe something like that. I'll say there are six 'turns', to get things done, and I'll arbitrarily decide if something takes long enough to be deserving of a turn. Basically, traveling + doing something, or doing something that takes a while will spend a turn, and other stuff will happen. I'll make it clear when something will take time. "This will take some time." And maybe use a BitD style clock, with the final bit of it being 'Commencement Speech.' 

- At the core of it, the two groups basically operate independently, occasionally 'syncing' up via a single member. I'll say this happens on Turn 3 and Turn 6.
- **Raid Group "AI"**:
  - Caricx and Solovic go around, intimidating the fuck out of the other guards. They might target the players if they're alone.
  - Martyn and Morwyn accomplish simple sabotages. They look for a quick exit if caught, and try to find the other two. They have three firebombs between them.
  - Once they've scared the guards, Caricx and Solovic go around planting bombs and the other sabotages. The bombs are always top priority.
  - Solovic is sent out as a liaison on Turn 3 & 6.
- **Infiltration Group "AI"**:
  - Gather information, generally being split up.
    - Asking questions - near the church, and away from it.
    - Casing the joint - near the church
  - Locate the Mayor (T2) -> Isolate (T3) -> Charm (T4)
    - Many people asking, and then Callach Se for T3 and T4.
  - Get small weapons from outskirts
  - Callach Se retreats for the Ritual (T5 -> T6)
    - So basically, Callach Se is occupied T3->T6, and will be in the crowd again for the speech.
  - Annaleise is the liaison on Turn 3 & 6.

Turn 7 is the speech itself, so one more chance (kind of) and then everything major starts happening. 

#### The Felflame of Asternoth
Focuses on fire and burning things away, physically and metaphorically. The Sorcerer wields the power through a deep black coin that feels warm to the touch. The Sorcerer can make the flames within it burn extremely hot at will, and can use it as a source of fire in a pinch. If the Sorcerer is killed, then Asternoth will choose a new bearer, attempting subtle influence by making his choice feel special.
- Animate (Fire) - Concentration, Resist (Special)
- Palsy - Resist (Endurance) - Black / green flames encircle the limb and make it painfully unusable
- Tap (Physical) - Resist (Special) - Allows the Sorcerer to steal characteristics from those they have marked with Asternoth's unholy symbol
- Wrack (Fire) - Concentration, Resist (Evade) - Bolts of felflame
- Enslave (Human) - Resist (Willpower) - Instilling a burning passion within them
- Diminish (Cha, Int) - Resist (Willpower) - Burn away the target's mind to make them more susceptible to manipulation 

The way this Sorcerer works is by: 
- Diminishing people, making them easier to manipulate (Diminish)
- Instilling fiery passion of Greed into the bandits (Enslave) 
- Tapping into their branded individuals for better physical power (Tap)
- Controlling fire to be a shepherd of flame (Wrack, Animate, Palsy)

I've decided that the sorcerer has to 'prepare' their spells ahead of time, as they can only have three prepared at the same time. At the start, they have Diminish, Enslave and Palsy prepared. Just before the raid, they switch out to more 'powerful' spells, once their ritual is complete, having access to Animate, Tap and Wrack instead.

His master, Asternoth, has gifted him several 'flame devices' that the bandits believe to be technological in nature. They are essentially remote firebombs, set off by a unique magical signature (the bearer of the coin), and explode in a burst of flame, setting everything nearby alight. He has to be in the general vicinity, but otherwise has no information about them besides setting them off.

## Vampire Oneshot Idea
Players are shovelheads, recently turned by the Sabbat. They starve them a little, and entice them to run through a gauntlet designed to strip them of their humanity. All part of a recruiting drive so they can take these new recruits and roll them over into capturing some vital thing. 

When I originally had this idea, I always envisioned like a...
- Waking up from Mass Grave thing
- Organizing into groups / being organized into groups to be forced to do Vaulderie

But from there it's like, where do I go? First meal -> disorganized raid onto something? Sounds like a lot of combat, not a lot of other stuff.
