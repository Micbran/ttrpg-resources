### Mythras Oneshot Idea
- Starts a little bit like Rise of the Runelords, players are in a decently-sized town for a once a decade festival.
  - So plenty of little festival games, food, drink and other fun stuff to deal with.
- Then, at some point during a pivotal point during the festival, an outcast sorcerer attacks with a band of bandits who have infiltrated the town and set up sabotages
  - You know, all things the players could pick up on before the whole thing. Or get a bad idea, and kick this whole thing off early.
  - Or make themselves enough of a problem for the bandits / sorcerer to confront them more directly / indirectly. 
- And from there, we go to combat, though I want to make it fairly dynamic, so there's some thinking there.

In short:
- Festival games, and roaming
- Hints of weird things, or suspicious people
- Grand speech -> culminates in an attack
  - Probably by starting a fire, and then apprehending people as they split up. Meanwhile, the other group dives for the church.

Things we need:
- Background
- List of festival games
- List of sabotages
- A real plot reason for the sorcerer doing this, and the bandits for helping
- The actual content of the oneshot, and all that shit. 

#### Plot Stuff
- The sorcerer wants a specific relic that the town is responsible for guarding. They plan to steal it under the guise of a raid, so it looks less overt. If the raid goes well, fine, but if not, they still get the relic. To that end, the bandits are in two teams, one of them is the main raid group, the other are extracting the relic with the sorcerer.
  - Clue: Looking for a relic: People asking weird questions about the relic, people canvassing the town's church, someone REALLY asking for a tour of the church
  - Clue: Two groups: A tattoo or branding that ties the two groups together, 
  - Clue: Guise of a raid:
  - Clue: Organizer is a sorcerer: The relic is said to secrete a single magical tear once a decade (magical importance), strange things happening in and around the festival, charmed priest

- General stuff:
  - 8 bandits, one of them is a lieutenant sorta guy, one of them is the sorcerer them self.
  - They're gonna form two squads, 1 squad of 4, with the lieutenant, and another squad of 'disguised' bandits, with the sorcerer.
    - The first squad is going to pretend to be guards as well.
    - The second squad is going to spread out and 'case the joint' so to speak.
  - Maybe the Sorcerer tries to impersonate the mayor via magic? Noticeable by how he's acting different. 

### Vampire Oneshot Idea
Players are shovelheads, recently turned by the Sabbat. They starve them a little, and entice them to run through a gauntlet designed to strip them of their humanity. All part of a recruiting drive so they can take these new recruits and roll them over into capturing some vital thing.
